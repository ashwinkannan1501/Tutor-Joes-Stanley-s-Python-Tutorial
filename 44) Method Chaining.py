Method Chaining :-
---------------------
    The Method Chaining is the process of calling different methods in a single line instead of calling other methods
with the same object reference separately.

    Under this procedure, we have to write the object reference once and then call the methods by separating them with
a dot notation (.)

    It is also known as parameter idioms (or) train wreck because of á¹­he increase in the number of methods even though
line breaks are often added between methods.

SYNTAX :-
----------
    ----------------------------------------
    | obj.method1().method2().method3()... |
    ----------------------------------------

    Invoking methods one after the another is called method chaining.
